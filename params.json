Setup your Google App using the [Google APIs console](https://code.google.com/apis/console).\r\n    Detailed instructions [here](http://ben.onfabrik.com/posts/oauth-providers#google)\r\n\r\n 2. Install this library from [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2),\r\n\r\n        PM> Install-Package DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2\r\n \r\n ... or download from the [releases page](https://github.com/mj1856/DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2/releases) and add a reference\r\n \r\n ... or compile from source and add a reference\r\n\r\n 3. Register the client instead of the existing Google OpenId client.\r\n\r\n ```csharp\r\n var client = new GoogleOAuth2Client(\"yourClientId\", \"yourClientSecret\");\r\n var extraData = new Dictionary<string, object>();\r\n OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterClient(client, \"Google\", extraData);\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nJust like any other `OAuthWebSecurity` client, except you need one extra hook:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// add this line\r\nGoogleOAuth2Client.RewriteRequest();\r\n\r\n// it belongs right before your existing call to\r\nOAuthWebSecurity.VerifyAuthentication(....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is needed because Google requires that any extra querystring parameters for the\r\nredirect be packed into a single parameter called `state`.  Since `OAuthWebSecurity` needs\r\ntwo parameters, `__provider__` and `__sid__` - we have to rewrite the url.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The `RewriteRequest` method will unpack the `state` parameter and place its contents back into the regular querystring.\r\nSo if you are looking for a state value such as `ReturnUrl`, you will find it has been moved to `Request.QueryString[\"ReturnUrl\"]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nI don't work for Google, Microsoft, or DNOA.  This is released under the [MIT](LICENCE.txt) licence.  Do what you want with it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
